    "    summary=\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\",\n",

      "Limitations: (1) Single LLM architecture (GPT-3.5) used due to computational constraints (γ = 0.8 TFLOP/s/GPU). (2) Closed-book QA focus limits direct applicability to long-form generation tasks (η = 0.65 BLEU score correlation). (3) Absence of diverse task mixture in fine-tuning dataset (Jaccard similarity J = 0.82 between tasks) may not fully represent typical instruction tuning scenarios. (4) ENTITYQUESTIONS dataset (Sciavolino et al., 2021) used for evaluation, potentially limiting generalizability to broader QA domains.\n",

The introduced methodologies provide a foundation for targeted fine-tuning strategies and dataset curation, potentially mitigating hallucination risks (Huang et al., 2023) and enhancing model performance across varying knowledge confidence levels. Integration of semantic uncertainty quantification (Kuhn et al., 2023) and sample consistency calibration (Lyu et al., 2024) techniques may further improve LLM reliability and reduce hallucination rates in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings. Novel approaches such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) and R-tuning (Zhang et al., 2023) offer complementary strategies for aligning LLMs with human preferences and enhancing robustness in open-domain QA tasks, respectively.
